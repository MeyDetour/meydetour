Hello! âœ¨ 
My name is Mey Detour, and I'm in my second year of web development. 
I'm based in Lyon but often in Paris, too. I'm always learning, growing, and deeply passionate about tech! 
I like to say that communication is the key to everything. So, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out and say hiâ€”I'm open, curious, and excited to connect! âœ¨
